# Peripheral-Interfacing-with-8051-Microcontroller

This project demonstrates the use of the 8051 microcontroller to interface with peripheral devices, specifically a 4x4 keypad and a 7-segment display unit. The system is designed to capture user inputs via the keypad and display the corresponding output on the 7-segment display. It also performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input and features real-time display updates.

# Features
Keypad and Display Interface: Real-time input from a 4x4 keypad is displayed on a 7-segment display using the 8051 microcontroller.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: The system supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with results displayed on the 7-segment unit.
Optimized Display: Reduced flicker and improved handling of concurrent key presses for a smooth user experience.
Reset Functionality: Allows users to reset the display using a designated key for quick and easy operations.
Scalability and Future Enhancements: Explores potential use of interrupts to reduce code complexity and improve efficiency.

# Components
8051 Microcontroller: The main processing unit that controls the peripheral devices.
8255 Peripheral Interface Adapter: Interfaces the microcontroller with the keypad and display.
4x4 Keypad: Allows user input for performing various operations.
7-Segment Display: Displays user inputs and results from arithmetic operations.
MCU 8051 IDE: Used for writing and debugging the Assembly Language code for the 8051 microcontroller.

# Circuit Design
Keypad Connection: The 4x4 keypad is connected to the 8051 microcontroller via the 8255 interface. The rows and columns of the keypad are configured to detect key presses and transmit the corresponding signals to the microcontroller.

Display Connection: The 7-segment display is connected to the microcontroller through the 8255 interface. The microcontroller sends data to the display to show the numerical output based on keypad input.

# Code Description
The program is written in Assembly Language, specifically designed for the 8051 microcontroller.
It initializes the keypad and display units, configures ports, and sets up the 8255 interface for communication.
The main loop waits for a key press, processes the input, and updates the display.
Arithmetic operations are performed when specific keys are pressed, and the results are displayed on the 7-segment unit.
The system includes functions to handle display updates, clear the display, and reset operations.
